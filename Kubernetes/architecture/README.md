### How to install minikube

1. Install Kubectl

Kubectl is Kubernetesâ€™ command line tool which you need to interact with your cluster. To download the latest release, you can use the following command:

`curl -LO "https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/$(curl -s https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/stable.txt)/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl"`

2. Make your binary executable:

`chmod +x ./kubectl`

3. Move it to your executable path. For example if `/usr/local/bin/` is in your executable path:

`sudo mv ./kubectl /usr/local/bin/kubectl`

4. Install Minikube
There are three ways you can install Minikube, via a package, direct download, or with Homebrew. If you want to use a package, you can use your built-in package tool to find the right option.

If you want to install via direct download, use the following command:

`curl -Lo minikube https://storage.googleapis.com/minikube/releases/latest/minikube-linux-amd64 \ && chmod +x minikube`

5. Confirm installation

After your installation of the hypervisor and Minikube are complete you can start your local cluster.

`minikube start `
